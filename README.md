# tywlsbook

<p>This is a project for our iOS Mobile App Development class. The purpose of our app is to centralize all of our schools' policies so that students have easy access to them without having to rely on occasional emails or having to go on long searches  to double-check that they aren't breaking the rules, while also giving students a space to express their feelings on certain policies without compromising their reputation or anonymity.</p>

<p>We have a Figma prototype as well, <a href="https://www.figma.com/design/YFd6RgLzBBovihZBN4lvP4/TYWLSBook">which can be found here</a>.</p>
